#### 1. bankholiday.py Program

When you run this program, it connects to the UK Governmentâ€™s open data API and retrieves the official list of bank holidays for Northern Ireland.
It then prints out the name and date of each holiday in a simple, readable format.


#### 2. What was learned :cd:
    - How to import and use the requests library to get live data from an online API
    - How to read and parse JSON data into a Python dictionary
    - How to loop through and print structured data clearly
    - How to format text output using f-strings


#### 3. Program Code :floppy_disk:

```python
import requests                                     # fetch data from the web

# URL for UK Government bank holidays API
url = "https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json"       # public data source

# Fetch and parse JSON data
response = requests.get(url)                        # send GET request
data = response.json()                              # convert JSON to dictionary

# Extract Northern Ireland bank holidays
ni_holidays = data["northern-ireland"]["events"]    # access Northern Ireland list

print("\nBank Holidays in Northern Ireland:\n")     # header text
for event in ni_holidays:                           # loop through each holiday
    print(f"{event['title']}: {event['date']}")     # print name and date'
```
