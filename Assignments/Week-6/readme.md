#### 1.  Program

This notebook analyzes hourly weather data from Dublin Airport using real data from Met Éireann. It cleans and processes the dataset to explore temperature and windspeed trends over time. It produces visualizations showing Hourly, daily mean, and monthly mean temperatures, Hourly windspeed, rolling 24-hour averages, daily maximums, and monthly mean of daily maximums

The analysis demonstrates how to clean, group, and visualize real-world time-series data using Pandas and Matplotlib



#### 2. What was learned :cd:
    - How to load and clean real-world CSV data directly from a URL
    - How to resample and group data by day and month
    - How to use rolling averages for smoothing noisy time-series data
    - How to visualize patterns using Matplotlib


#### 3. Program Code :floppy_disk:

```python
